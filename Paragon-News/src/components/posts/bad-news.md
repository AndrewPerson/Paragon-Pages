*REALLY BAD NEWS*. Someone stuffed up real bad with the school servers, and for some reason, they are still returning the current day's timetable even after school has ended. This means that Paragon *will not be able to update your daily timetable until the start of the next day*. I'll be releasing a hotfix for this sometime tomorrow, hopefully.

As far as I can tell, this also affects Dinnerjacket and Classti, but not the Student Portal.
