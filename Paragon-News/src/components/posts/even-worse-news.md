Currently, the problem with the school servers is *continuing*.  This means that you currently *will not be able to access your daily timetable*. I will be releasing a fix soon, hopefully sometime today. However, it will probably not be active until Friday. Because of that, and I hate to say this, don't use Paragon until then. Due to some \*cough\* bad \*cough\* programming, for the time being, Paragon will continually refresh itself, chewing up a lot of battery and also spam my servers with lots of requests.

So, just to recap, *don't use Paragon until Friday* and keep checking here for updates.
