The hotfix for stopping Paragon from constantly reloading is released! In order to get it, head to [settings](https://web-paragon.web.app/settings) and press "Fix". (Don't do this on the school wifi as Paragon is blocked at school and this will simply make it so that you can't access Paragon at all.) Note that this won't cause your daily timetable to appear. It simply makes it so that Paragon stops constantly reloading.

If you have any bugs, head to the [Paragon Support Discord Server](https://discord.gg/ADe73MFV).

In summary, head to [settings](https://web-paragon.web.app) and press "Fix" as soon as you can.
