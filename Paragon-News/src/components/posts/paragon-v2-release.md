title: Paragon v2 Release
date: "2022-01-16"
---
TLDR; Paragon v2 is being released in Term 2 and you can view the beta version [here](https://paragon.pages.dev) during Term 1.

<br>
While I know a lot of you were hoping that I could have Paragon v2 out by the start of Term 1, I unfortunately will not be releasing it then. Instead, the full release will be (hopefully) at the start of Term 2.

<br>
There are a number of reasons for this, the 2 main ones being:

1. I need time for testing Paragon.

2.  I'm hoping to get the domain paragon.au.

<br>
During Term 1, a beta version of Paragon v2 will be available at [https://paragon.pages.dev](https://paragon.pages.dev). This version can, and will, change at any notice and may show incorrect data while I iron out all the bugs.

See you all at school!
