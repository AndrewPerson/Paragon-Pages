The daily timetable has been fixed! It does however, show sport as a class with "No one". I'll be looking at making that appear as a break, like Lunch and Recess, rather than a class. Another thing is that recess is now labelled as "Break". Not sure if it's a permanent change. Either way you can tell me on the [discord server](https://discord.gg/Hkd8UWUFuj) whether you prefer it this way or not. The timetable still looks a bit weird, but I'll probably be fixing that tonight. Fingers crossed that no more massive changes come out and break Paragon again.
