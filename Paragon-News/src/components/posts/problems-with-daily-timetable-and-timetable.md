title: Problems with Timetable and Dailytimetable
date: "2021-11-16"

Starting sometime around yesterday, the school servers started returning blank responses for the timetable. This means that the timetable in Paragon will be stuck in a state of infinite loading. It also means that the dailytimetable will just be blank, or show an error message. I don't know when this will be fixed. However, *everything else will remain working.* You can still view the daily announcements and use your barcode to scan in.
