title: Problems with daily timetable and timetable

Well, it appears that something has been changed on the school servers with regards to the data. Currently, the daily timetable is broken, and will be stuck infinitely loading. I'll look into whether it is to do with the format for the data *permanently* changing, or just a temporary error. Also, the timetable is working, but the class names look weird now. I'll look into fixing that as well, but it's not high priority as it's technically not broken.
