### What is Paragon v2?
Originally, Paragon was planned to be released with more features than are currently available. Features such as extensions and a calendar. However, due to time constraints, a lot of these features were left out when releasing Paragon.

The idea was to get Paragon released as fast as possible so people would start using it, then release these more complex features later on. This is what will be happening in Paragon v2. (Paragon v3 is also in the planning stage. It will be focusing on improving the performance of Paragon.)

### What features are coming out in Paragon v2?
There are 3 main features coming out:

1. Pages. (Extensions.)

2. The ability to change the colours of Paragon.

3. A full-screen daily timetable.

### Extensions
You're all probably wondering why Extensions are being called "Pages".  This is because I feel that the name Pages better reflects what they do. Pages will be extra pages you can add on to Paragon to add more functionality. This will allow me to add new features to Paragon very quickly, and without sacrificing performance. Due to school policy, only me and anyone else who actively contributes to Paragon can make Pages.

### Changing Colours
This is very straightforward. In the settings area there will be a slider you can drag to adjust the colours for Paragon. This will also carry over to the login and logging in screens as well. I added it because it just seemed like something fun to do.

### Full Screen Daily Timetable
This was a feature in Sublimate, which not many people remember by now, but it was removed in other apps. It's now being added to Paragon!
Basically, it allows you to full-screen the daily timetable and view only the information about the next class. Information such as, how much longer until it, who the teacher is, and where it is.

This will be useful to people who like to make Paragon very small so they can zoom in on the next class bit of the Daily Timetable, and for people who like to put Paragon in sidebars in their browsers.
