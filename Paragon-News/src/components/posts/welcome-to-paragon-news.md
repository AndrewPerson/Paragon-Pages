### What is this page?
This page is for **Paragon News**! (If you hadn't guessed already.) Paragon News is designed to let me reliably and quickly send out any notifications about upcoming updates to Paragon.

This will be especially important at the beginning of Term 1 next year, as Paragon *v2* will be coming out, which will bring a lot of changes. (You can bet they're going to be really cool! I'll outline some of the changes in another post.)

### What happened to Extensions?
As you might have noticed, the Paragon News page has replaced the page for Extensions. This is mainly because the page for Extensions was fairly useless. It *does not* mean that Extensions won't be happening, they'll still be going ahead.

On that note, due to a bit of clash with school policy, Extensions are going to be slightly altered in the way they work. (Then again, not many people know how they were meant to work anyways. I'll explain this in the post about all the changes in Paragon v2.)
