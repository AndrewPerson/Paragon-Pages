title: The Barcodes Extension is being Discontinued
date: "2022-12-18"
---
Due to some legal complications and the fact that it appears to go against the school policy in general, the Barcodes extension is now discontinued and will be removed in February next year. This means that not only will the extension no longer be available for install, but it will also be uninstalled for any existing users. Any existing users should download their barcodes by February next year.
